# ev-net-impact/sql_queries/

This folder contains the results of SQL queries used to visualise data for the ev-net-impact project.

Each query corresponds to a Tableau Online visualisation and is described below.

### Query 0
* Retrieves emissions by production source data by year and region. Additional columns added to calculate total and identify countries and continents.
* Visual: treemap showing proportion of world emissions from electricity generation produced by each country or continent.

### Query 1
* Displays electricity production by source as a percentage of total production by year and country or continent.
* Visual: 100% bar chart colour-coded by electricity source, showing change from 1985 to 2020 for top producing countries/continents.
